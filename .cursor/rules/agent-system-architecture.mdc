## Core Agent System

The agent architecture consists of specialized agents coordinated through a hub system:

### Primary Agent Types (Importance: 90)
- Main Orchestrator Agent (`agenthub/main.py`)
  - Routes requests to specialized agents
  - Manages context and state between agent handoffs
  - Coordinates multi-agent workflows

- Memory Agent (`agenthub/memagent.py`)
  - Handles conversation history retrieval
  - Maintains context across sessions
  - Provides relevant historical information to other agents

- Google Integration Agent (`integrations/google/google_agent.py`)
  - Manages Gmail and Calendar operations
  - Handles OAuth authentication flows
  - Provides tool access for email and calendar queries

### Agent Handoff System (Importance: 85)
Located in `src/zerozen/agents.py`:
- Dynamic agent switching based on request type
- Context preservation during handoffs
- Tool permission management between agents
- State synchronization during transitions

### Tool Integration Pattern (Importance: 80)
- Tools are packaged as service classes:
  - `GmailService` - Email operations
  - `CalendarService` - Calendar management
  - Memory tools for context storage/retrieval
- Agents access tools through standardized interfaces
- Tool state persists across agent handoffs

### Request Triage System (Importance: 75)
- Initial request analysis in main hub
- Request classification by domain and intent
- Dynamic tool allocation based on request type
- Priority-based routing for concurrent requests

## Agent Workflows

### Core Processing Flow (Importance: 85)
1. Request received by main agent
2. Context loaded from memory agent
3. Tool requirements determined
4. Request routed to specialized agent
5. Results aggregated and returned

### Integration Points (Importance: 70)
- Memory system interface for context storage
- Google API integration for service access
- Cross-agent communication protocols
- Tool state synchronization
